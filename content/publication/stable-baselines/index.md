# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract: "Stable-Baselines3 provides open-source implementations of deep reinforcement learning
(RL) algorithms in Python. The implementations have been benchmarked against reference
codebases, and automated unit tests cover 95% of the code. The algorithms follow a
consistent interface and are accompanied by extensive documentation, making it simple to
train and compare different RL algorithms. Our documentation, examples, and source-code
are available at https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3."
