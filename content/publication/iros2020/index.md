# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract: "This paper proposes a new approach for online control law gains adaptation, through the use of neural networks and the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm, in order to optimize the behavior of the robot with respect to an objective function. The neural network considered takes as input the current observed state as well as its uncertainty, and provides as output the control law gains. It is trained, using the CMA-ES algorithm, on a simulator reproducing the vehicle dynamics. Then, it is tested in real conditions on an agricultural mobile robot at different speeds. The transferability of this method from simulation to a real system is demonstrated, as well as its robustness to environmental changes, such as GPS signal degradation or ground variation. As a result, path following errors are reduced, while ensuring tracking stability."
